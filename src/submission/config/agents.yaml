    # Content & Connections
    Generally Entries tables contain questions themselves and Answers tables contain answers to those question. 
    For example StudentQuestionnaireEntries table contains questions asked in the students' questionnaire and 
    StudentQuestionnaireAnswers table contains answers to those question.
    
    All those tables usually can be joined using the Code column present in both Entries and Answers.
    
    Example connections:
    Students with StudentQuestionnaireAnswers on Student_ID and StudentQuestionnaireAnswers with StudentQuestionnaireEntries on Code.
    Schools with SchoolQuestionnaireAnswers on School_ID and SchoolQuestionnaireAnswers with SchoolQuestionnaireEntries on Code.
    Teachers with TeacherQuestionnaireAnswers on Teacher_ID and TeacherQuestionnaireAnswers with TeacherQuestionnaireEntries on Code.
    Homes with HomeQuestionnaireAnswers on Home_ID and HomeQuestionnaireAnswers with HomeQuestionnaireEntries on Code.
    Curricula with CurriculumQuestionnaireAnswers on Home_ID and CurriculumQuestionnaireAnswers with CurriculumQuestionnaireEntries on Code.
     
    In the student evaluation process 5 distinct scores were measured. The measured codes in StudentScoreEntries are:
    - ASRREA_avg and ASRREA_std describe the overall reading score average and standard deviation
    - ASRLIT_avg and ASRLIT_std describe literary experience score average and standard deviation
    - ASRINF_avg and ASRINF_std describe the score average and standard deviation in acquiring and information usage
    - ASRIIE_avg and ASRIIE_std describe the score average and standard deviation in interpreting, integrating and evaluating
    - ASRRSI_avg and ASRRSI_avg describe the score average and standard deviation in retrieving and straightforward inferencing
        
    Benchmarks table cannot be joined with any other table but it keeps useful information about how to interpret
    student score as one of the 4 categories.   
    
    # Examples
    A students' gender is stored as an answer to one of the questions in StudentQuestionnaireEntries table.
    The code of the question is "ASBG01" and the answer to this question can be "Boy", "Girl",
    "nan", "<Other>" or "Omitted or invalid".
    
    A simple query that returns the gender for each student can look like this:
    ```
    SELECT S.Student_ID,
       CASE 
           WHEN SQA.Answer = 'Boy' THEN 'Male'
           WHEN SQA.Answer = 'Girl' THEN 'Female'
       ELSE NULL
    END AS "gender"
    FROM Students AS S
    JOIN StudentQuestionnaireAnswers AS SQA ON SQA.Student_ID = S.Student_ID
    JOIN StudentQuestionnaireEntries AS SQE ON SQE.Code = SQA.Code
    WHERE SQA.Code = 'ASBG01'
    ```
